# IPSO
## _Project background_ ï¼š
  Financial distress prediction is a complex task, which involves feature selection and model construction. While many studies have addressed these challenges individually, there is a lack of FDP models that integrate feature selection into the entire model building process. To solve the problem of fast convergence and local optimization of particle swarm optimization (PSO), an improved PSO algorithm, IPSO, is proposed. This paper will be embedded in a state-of-the-art tree-lifting integration model for feature selection.
